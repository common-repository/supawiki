Export WordPress data to Supawiki.

== Description ==

### Supawiki migrator: the easy way to migrate data to Supawiki

The official Supawiki plugin allows you to export your WordPress data in a JSON format that can be imported by [Supawiki](https://www.supawiki.com).

#### Features overview

The Supawiki migrator plugin will export as much blog and publication data as it can into a clean set of exported files.

- Posts, pages, tags and authors are all automatically exported and recreated for Supawiki; 
- Tags will be migrated, but not categories. If needed you can [convert your categories to tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/) before exporting;
- Supawiki does not have built-in comments;
- No custom fields, meta, shortcodes, post types, taxonomies or binary files will be migrated. Just regular **posts**, **pages**, **tags** and **images**;
- Passwords are not migrated - after importing to Supawiki, each user may perform a password reset to gain access to their Supawiki account.
